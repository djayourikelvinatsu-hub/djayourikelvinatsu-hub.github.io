# Stepping into the Darkness

When deciding on a dark mode color palette, a common trend is to use very dark blue-grays or off-blacks like `#121212` (Material Design's recommendation). However, there is a compelling argument for embracing **True Black** (`#000000`).

## The OLED Advantage

OLED screens work by completely turning off individual pixels that display `#000000`. This leads to two massive benefits:
1. **Infinite Contrast Ratio:** True black next to pure white creates the highest possible contrast ratio.
2. **Battery Savings:** Pixels that are turned off consume absolutely zero power.

### Implementation Example

In Tailwind v4, configuring a True Black dark mode can be incredibly simple using CSS variables:

```css
@layer base {
  .dark {
    --background: #000000;
    --foreground: #ffffff;
    --card: #0a0a0a; /* Slight elevation for cards */
  }
}
```

By adding a tiny bit of elevation to our cards (`#0a0a0a`), we create depth without sacrificing the sleekness of the true black background.
