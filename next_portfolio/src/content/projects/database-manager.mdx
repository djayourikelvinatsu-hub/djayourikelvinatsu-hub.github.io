# Problem Statement & Solution
Visualizing complex database architectures and data trends can be overwhelming for non-technical stakeholders. 
The solution is a React-based interface powered by D3.js that takes raw PostgreSQL queries and converts them into interactive, easy-to-digest data visualizations.

# Technical Architecture

<Mermaid chart={`
graph TD
    User([Business Analyst]) --> UI[React Dashboard]
    
    subgraph Frontend
        UI --> D3[D3.js Visualization Engine]
        UI --> QueryBuilder[Custom Query Builder Component]
    end
    
    subgraph Backend
        QueryBuilder --> API[Node.js / Express API]
        API --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    end
`} />

# Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts (bar, pie, scatter) handling thousands of data points smoothly.
- **Query Builder**: A visual interface for constructing complex SQL queries without needing to write code.
- **CSV Export**: Instantly export visualization data or query results to CSV format.
