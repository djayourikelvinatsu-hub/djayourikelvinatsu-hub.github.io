# Problem Statement & Solution
The legacy e-commerce platform suffered from a monolithic architecture and a poorly implemented light mode that caused severe eye strain during long shopping sessions.
The solution was to perform a complete rebuild utilizing Next.js for server-side rendering, and strictly adhering to a dynamic "True Black" dark mode for accessibility.

# Performance Impact

# Code Snippet: Dark Theme Local Storage Sync

```tsx
"use client";
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

// Synchronizes the application's True Black theme across tabs
// without causing layout shifts or hydration errors.
export function useThemeSync() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('dark');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const channel = new BroadcastChannel('theme_sync');
    channel.onmessage = (e) => {
       if (e.data.theme) setTheme(e.data.theme);
    };
    return () => channel.close();
  }, []);
  
  return theme;
}
```
