# Problem Statement & Solution
I needed a responsive, performant way to showcase my skills and past projects. The initial solution was built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to ensure maximum performance and lack of framework overhead, while strictly adhering to accessibility best practices.

# Technical Architecture

<Mermaid chart={`

        Static --> Theme[Dark/Light Theme Toggle (CSS Variables)]
        Static --> Animations[CSS Keyframes & Intersection Observer]
    end
`} />

# Key Features
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Utilizes CSS variables and local storage to persist user preferences.
- **Smooth Animations**: High-performance CSS transitions triggered via Intersection Observer for lazy loading.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to scale flawlessly from 360px mobile screens up to 1920px desktop monitors.

# Performance Impact

Because this was built without a heavy framework, the performance metrics approach near-perfect Lighthouse scores automatically.

| Metric | Score | 
|--------|-------|
| **LCP**| < 1.0s |
| **TTI**| < 1.0s | 
| **Total Size**| ~65KB |
